constraint layout - requires anchors for every element, tedious
we will use linearview
right click UI > convert view> linearview

LinearLayout = LLv LLh (vertical, horizontal)
containers hold controls

vertical makes controls stack vertically, can not concatenate controls on same row
horizontal does the same thing but in columns
we can mix both
