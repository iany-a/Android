SOAP & REST Services / XML & JSON

use 3rd party libraries considered wrappers on top of the SDK

Web Services

SOAP services - legacy - unsupported in Android by default, but supported via 3rd party libraries e.g. KSOAP - wrapper on top of SDK
REST services   -used by most apps
		-stateless - can't carry a state with them
		-forced to use a longer processing flow on the server side in order to bypass the stateless propriety
		-pass data to an endpoint via POST - query parameters - in the URL path
		-the server processes the request and returns a JSON file
		-the processes of sending and receiving data comes with a high security risk
		-parameters in the URL (not encoded - raw) can be hacked (e.g. client ID can be shown in the URL)
