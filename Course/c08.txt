SOAP & REST Services / XML & JSON

use 3rd party libraries considered wrappers on top of the SDK

Web Services

SOAP services   -legacy - unsupported in Android by default, but supported via 3rd party libraries e.g. kSOAP2 - wrapper on top of SDK
		-simulate a Remote Procedure Call - RPC (inter-process communication)
		-*serialization of objects in Android is done as to prevent unreachable pointers to the objects = the object is sent as a list of bytes with dummy fields in between
		-elements: SoapObject, SoapSerializationEnvelope, etc
		-uses WSDL to pass info via XML:
			-wsdl:message is a parameter
		-Android: needs a separate thread
		-443 = HTTPS protocol port
		



REST services   -used by most apps
		-stateless - can't carry a state with them
		-forced to use a longer processing flow on the server side in order to bypass the stateless propriety
		-pass data to an endpoint via POST - query parameters - in the URL path
		-the server processes the request and returns a JSON file
		-the processes of sending and receiving data comes with a high security risk
		-parameters in the URL (not encoded - raw) can be hacked (e.g. client ID can be shown in the URL)
		-HTTP protocol - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. = text
		-response: JSON or XML = text
		-what we learn: how to parse XML and JSON files (e.g. XML: Array of objects in a collection)
			XML
			->3 ways:
				-SAX - Sequential reading of an XML file -inverse order events
				 SAX Methods: getParser(), getSchema();
				 SAXParserFactory =>>> XMLReader =>>> create SAXHandler and parse using the xmlReader
				-XML Pull -Sequential reading - directly treated events
				-DOM - hierarchical structure generated
		
		
		
		
		
		DOM - very tedious / time consuming
			
			JSON
			-> JSONObject
				getType(): getString(), getBoolean(), getInt() etc.
			-uses Retrofit>>> POJO = 1:1 mapping between a JSON object and JAVA class
			-code: HTTPConnectionService class: getData(), postData()
